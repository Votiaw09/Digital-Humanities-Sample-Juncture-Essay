_Simeon Solomon_ by Simeon Solomon depicts the famous Pre-Raphaelite painter, renouned by contemporary audiences for his depictions of Jewish life as well as same-sex attraction in his paintings. Solomon's work would later be collected by Oscar Wilde, introduced to his body of work during his time in Oxford. Solomon, like Wilde some decades later, had his life cut short by sodomy charges brought on by London police that led to his imprisonment and subsequent fall into alcoholism and obscurity.[^1]

_Sappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytilene_ by Simeon Solomon, done in 1864, is a depiction of the two sixth-century poets that were allegedly peers. Depictions of same-sex relationships in London during the 19th century was still largely forbidden, and even the action of Sappho gently embracing Erinna would have been considered a daring artistic risk.[^1]
